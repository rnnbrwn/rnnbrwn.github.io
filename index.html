					Hal√≥, is mise <em class="yellowHighlight">Ronnie</em>, and I'm
					building a site. Here's a
					<a

				<h2>An introduction</h2>
				<p>
					tl;dr I used to build websites, this is my first real attempt in
					forever.
				</p>
				<p>
					I know how to build websites. But when I used to do it regularly it
					was tables, then it was divs and floats. I was the king of the
					clearfix. For the last few years I've managed people more than I've
					build websites, so let's see how this goes.
				</p>
				<p>
					This site will be a learn by doing site. I'll document what I'm doing,
					how I'm doing it, the resources I'm using, and the decisions I've
					made.
				</p>
				<p>First off, here's where we are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						I have a hosting account at Siteground, but I've decided against a
						CMS, and will likely try out something like a static site, using
						Gatsby. That being the case, I don't need a real hosting account, so
						here we are, using Github Pages.
					</li>
					<li>
						The address right now is
						<a href="https://rnnbrwn.github.io">rnnbrwn.github.io</a>, but I own
						<a href="http://ronniebrown.scot">ronniebrown.scot</a>, so I'll hook
						that up.
					</li>
					<li>
						Right now, I have index.html, style.css, basefonts.css - containing
						CSS created at
						<a href="https://type-scale.com/">type-scale.com</a>, and an SVG I
						created using AdobeCapture.
					</li>
					<li>
						I like the look of the colours at
						<a href="https://www.colourlovers.com/palette/4671871/Vintage"
							>colourlovers.com/Vintage</a
						>, and the values are commented out in my style.css, but I'm not
						using many of them right now.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					So, let's do this. Suggestions? Comments? Email me. Let's see how this
					goes.
