## Ronnie Brown, ronniebrown.scot

Site is built on Github Pages, and hosted at
[rnnbrwn.github.io](https://rnnbrwn.github.io).

### Rough plan for the site

I've had lots of personal sites in the past: 160676.net, lazybrown.co.uk, thisplaceisdead.com being the main ones. All of them were basic blogs. Handmade CMSs, that kind of thing. For a long time now, I've wanted to have a _proper_ online presence, and I've regularly created and hosted Wordpress sites, but rarely posted.

So, this is the new plan. ronniebrown.scot, hosted via Github Pages. A static site that will grow as I learn. Because here's the thing. I'm a web developer in name only, these days. It's been a _long_ time since I've produced much of note (a recent work site being the exception - https://www.emeahiltoncareers.com/). I manage people these days, but I'm determined to hone my dev skills and this is where we start.

This will be a learning by doing type of site. This site will evolve and we start with version 0.0.1, informally called, Rusty.

- add dates n taxonomy to any blog-type posts
- i have a bit of javascript on the welcome message, but forgot to mention it in the intro post
- the blog post header is the same as the Failte header, and that doesn't look right
- also, the spacing between the welcome message and the blog post needs to be greater
